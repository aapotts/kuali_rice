By default, when you check out a project from CVS, empty leaf
directories won't be created. One of the dataDictionary tests, however,
requires an empty directory. Fortunately, the DataDictionaryBuilder only
tries to process XML files (or, more precisely, files whose name ends in
.xml), so this placeholder file should be sufficient to both cause CVS
to create this directory when someone checks out the project for the
first time, and to allow the DataDictionary test for an empty directory
to interpret this directory as empty.
