        <title>Service call failover</title>
        
        <para>Failover works the same whether making direct service calls or
            using messaging.</para>
        
        <para>Services exported to the bus have automatic failover from the
            client's perspective. For example, if service A is deployed on machines
            1 and 2 and a client happens to get a proxy that points to machine 1 but
            machine 1 crashes, the KSB will automatically detect that the exception
            is a result of some network issue and direct the call to machine 2. KSB
            then removes machine 1 from the registry so new clients to the bus don't
            try to acquire the service. When machine 1 returns to the network it
            will register itself with the service registry and therefore the
            bus.</para>
        
        <para>When a message calls a service, the failover rules determine which
            service KSB assigns (topic or queue) to the message.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <title>Failover with queues</title>
        
        <para>Because queues require only one call between all beans bound to
            the queue, if a single call to a queue fails, failover to the next bean
            occurs. If successful, the call is done. If it is not successful, it
            continues until a suitable bean is found. If none is found, the message
            is marked for retry later. Eventually, the message either goes to KSB
            exception messaging or successfully completes.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <title>Failover with topics</title>
        
        <para>If a machine in a topic is unavailable, a failed call to that
            machine will continue to be retried until that call is successful or
            that call goes into KSB exception messaging.</para>
