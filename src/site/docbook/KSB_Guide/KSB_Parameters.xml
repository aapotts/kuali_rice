        </table></para>

      <section>
        <title>serviceServletUrl</title>

        <para>The URL that resolves to the KSB servlet that handles incoming
        requests from the service bus. All services exported onto the service
        bus use this value to construct their endpoint URLs when they are
        published to the service registry. See section below on configuring
        the <emphasis role="italic">KSBDispatcherServlet</emphasis>. This
        parameter should point to the absolute URL of where that servlet is
        mapped. It should include a trailing slash.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>application.id</title>

        <para>An identifier that indicates the name of the <emphasis
        role="italic">logical</emphasis> node on the service bus. If the
        application is running in a cluster, this should be the same for each
        machine in the cluster. This is used for namespacing of services,
        among other things. All services exported from the client application
        onto the service bus use this value as their default namespace unless
        otherwise specified.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>keystore.file, keystore.alias, keystore.password</title>

        <para>See the documentation below on keystore management.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>ksb.mode</title>

        <para>Mode in which to load the KSB module. Valid values are <emphasis
        role="italic">local</emphasis> and <emphasis
        role="italic">embedded</emphasis>. There is currently no difference in
        how the KSB module loads based on these settings. It will always try
        to load the KSB struts module if a <emphasis
        role="italic">KualiActionServlet</emphasis> is configured.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>ksb.url</title>

        <para>The URL of the KSB web application screens</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>rice.ksb.struts.config.files</title>

        <para>The file that defines the struts context for the KRice KSB
        struts module. The struts module is loaded automatically if a
        <emphasis role="italic">KualiActionServlet</emphasis> is configured in
        the <emphasis role="italic">web.xml</emphasis>.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>dev.mode</title>

        <para>Indicates whether this node should export and consume services
        from the entire service bus. If set to <emphasis
        role="italic">false</emphasis>, then the machine will not register its
        services in the global service registry. Instead, it can only consume
        services that it has available locally. In addition to this, other
        nodes on the service bus will not be able to "see" this node and will
        therefore not forward any messages to it.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>message.persistence</title>

        <para>If <emphasis role="italic">true</emphasis>, then messages will
        be persisted to the datastore. Otherwise, they will only be stored in
        memory. If message persistence is not turned on and the server is
        shutdown while there are still messages that need to be sent, those
        messages will be lost. For a production environment, it is recommended
        that message persistence be set to <emphasis
        role="italic">true</emphasis>.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>message.delivery</title>

        <para>Can be set to either <emphasis
        role="italic">synchronous</emphasis> or <emphasis
        role="italic">async</emphasis>. If this is set to <emphasis
        role="italic">synchronous</emphasis>, then messages that are sent in
        an asynchronous fashion using the KSB API will instead be sent
        synchronously. This is useful in certain development and unit testing
        scenarios. For a production environment, it is recommended that
        message delivery be set to <emphasis
        role="italic">async</emphasis>.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>message.off</title>

        <para>If set to <emphasis role="italic">true</emphasis> then
        asynchronous messages will not be sent. In the case that message
        persistence is turned on, they will be persisted in the message store
        and can even be picked up later using the Message Fetcher. However, if
        message persistence is turned off, these messages will be lost. This
        can be useful in certain debugging or testing scenarios.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>RouteQueue.maxRetryAttempts</title>

        <para>Sets the default number of retries that will be executed if a
        message fails to be sent. This retry count can also be customized for
        a specific service. (See Exposing Services on the Bus)</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>RouteQueue.timeIncrement</title>

        <para>Sets the default time increment between retry attempts. As with
        <emphasis role="italic">RouteQueue.maxRetryAttempts</emphasis> this
        can also be configured at the service level.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>RouteQueue.maxRetryAttemptsOverride</title>

        <para>If set with a number, it will temporarily set the retry attempts
        for ALL services going into exception routing. A good way to prevent
        all messages in a node that is having trouble from making it to
        exception routing is by setting the number arbitrarily high. The
        <emphasis role="italic">message.off</emphasis> param does the same
        thing.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Routing.ImmediateExceptionRouting</title>

        <para>If set to <emphasis role="italic">true</emphasis>, then messages
        that fail to be sent will not be re-tried. Instead their <emphasis
        role="italic">MessageExceptionHandler</emphasis> will be invoked
        immediately.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>useQuartzDatabase</title>

        <para>When using the embedded Quartz scheduler started by the KSB,
        indicates whether that Quartz scheduler should store its entries in
        the database. If this is <emphasis role="italic">true</emphasis>, then
        the appropriate Quartz properties should be set as well (see
        ksb.org.quartz.* below).</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>ksb.org.quartz.*</title>

        <para>Can be used to pass Quartz properties to the embedded Quartz
        scheduler. See the configuration documentation on the Quartz site.
        Essentially, any property prefixed with <emphasis
        role="bold">ksb.org.quartz</emphasis>. will have the "<emphasis
        role="italic">ksb.</emphasis>" portion stripped and will be sent as
        configuration parameters to the embedded Quartz scheduler.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>KSB Configurer Properties</title>

      <para>In addition to the configuration parameters available in the KRice
      configuration system, the <emphasis
      role="italic">KSBConfigurer</emphasis> bean has some properties that can
      be injected to configure it:</para>

      <section>
        <title>exceptionMessagingScheduler</title>

        <para>By default, the KSB uses an embedded Quartz scheduler for
        scheduling the retry of messages that fail to be sent. If desired, a
        Quartz scheduler can instead be injected into the KSBConfigurer and it
        will use that scheduler instead. See Quartz Scheduling for more
        detail.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>messageDataSource</title>

        <para>Specifies the <emphasis
        role="bold">javax.sql.DataSource</emphasis> to use for storing the
        asynchronous message queue. If not specified, this defaults to the
        DataSource injected into the RiceConfigurer.</para>

        <para>If this DataSource is injected, then the registryDataSource must
        also be injected, and vice-versa.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>registryDataSource</title>

        <para>Specifies the<emphasis role="bold">
        javax.sql.DataSource</emphasis> to use for reading and writing from
        the Service Registry. If not specified, this defaults to the
        DataSource injected into the RiceConfigurer.</para>

        <para>If this DataSource is injected, then the <emphasis
        role="bold">messageDataSource</emphasis> must also be injected, and
        vice-versa.</para>
