    <title>KSB Exception Messaging</title>
    
    <para>Exception Messaging is the set of services and configuration options
        that handle messages that cannot be delivered successfully. Exception
        Messaging is primarily used by configuring your service using the
        properties outlined in KSB Module Configuration. When services are
        configured to use message persistence and there is a problem invoking a
        service, the persisted message or service call is relied upon to make
        another call to that service until the call is either:<orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Successful</para>
            </listitem>
            
            <listitem>
                <para>Certain configuration policies have been met and the message
                    goes into the Exception state</para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist></para>
    
    <para>The Exception state means that KSB can't doing anything more with
        this message. The message will not invoke properly. That generally means
        that some sort of technical intervention is required by both the consumer
        and the provider of the service to determine what the problem is.</para>
    
    <para>All Exception behavior is configurable at the service level by
        setting the name of the class to be used as MessageExceptionHandler. This
        class determines what to do when a client of a service cannot invoke a
        message. The DefaultMessageExceptionHandler is enough to meet most
        requirements.</para>
    
    <para>When a message is put into the Exception state, KSB puts it back
        into the message store and marks it with a status of 'E'. At that point,
        it is up to the person responsible for monitoring this node on the bus to
        determine what to do with the message.</para>
    
    <para>Because the node exposing the service configures the
        MessageExceptionHandler, any clients depending on the service need that
        MessageExceptionHandler and any dependent code and configuration.</para>
