    <title>Thread Pool</title>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Thread pool</emphasis> is a feature that improves overall system
        performance by creating a pool of threads which can be independently used by the system
        to execute multiple tasks at the same time. A task can execute immediately if there is a
        thread in the pool that is available. If no thread is available, the task waits for a
        thread to become available from the pool before executing.</para>
    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Thread Pool</emphasis> screen is accessed from the <emphasis
        role="bold">Administration</emphasis> menu. It tells you the current state of the
        Thread Pool and allows you to change four parameters for the Thread Pool. The core pool
        size, the maximum pool size, the RouteQueue.TimeIncrement and the
        RouteQueue.maxRetryAttempts.</para>
