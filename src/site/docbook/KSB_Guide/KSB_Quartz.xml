<chapter xml:id="KSB_Quartz" xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0">
    <title>Quartz</title>
    <para>The Kuali Service Bus (KSB) uses Quartz to schedule delayed tasks, including retry
        attempts for messages that cannot be sent the first time. By default, KSB uses an
        embedded quartz scheduler that can be configured by passing parameters starting with
        "ksb.org.quartz." into the Rice configuration.</para>
    <para>You can inject a custom quartz scheduler if the application is already running one.
        See the Technical Reference Guide for KSB, Configuring Quartz for KSB for more
        information. </para>
    <para>Quartz is also known as the <emphasis role="bold">Exception Routing Queue</emphasis>. </para>

    <para>When you click the Quartz link on the Kuali Rice Portal Administration page, KSB
        displays the screen shown above. The contents of the table can be sorted in ascending or
        descending order by clicking on a column title. This technique works for all columns
        except Actions. The table contains this information on each job that is
        scheduled:</para>
