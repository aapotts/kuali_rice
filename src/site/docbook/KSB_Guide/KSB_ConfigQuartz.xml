    <title>Configuring Quartz for KSB</title>
    
    <section>
        <title>Quartz Scheduling</title>
        
        <para>The Kuali Service Bus (KSB) uses Quartz to schedule delayed tasks,
            including retry attempts for messages that cannot be sent the first
            time. By default, KSB uses an embedded quartz scheduler that can be
            configured by passing parameters starting with "<emphasis
                role="italic">ksb.org.quartz.</emphasis>" into the Rice
            configuration.</para>
        
        <para>If the application is already running a quartz scheduler, you can
            inject a custom quartz scheduler using code like this:</para>
        
        <programlisting>&lt;bean class="org.kuali.rice.ksb.messaging.config.KSBConfigurer"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;property name="exceptionMessagingScheduler"&gt;
        &lt;bean class="org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.SchedulerFactoryBean"&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/bean&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>
        
        <para>When you do this, KSB will not create an embedded scheduler but
            will instead use the one provided.</para>
