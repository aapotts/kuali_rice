    <title>Generating the Keystore</title>
    <para>For client applications to consume secured services hosted from a Rice server, you must
        generate a keystore. As an initial setup, you can use the keystore provided by Rice. There
        are three ways to get this keystore:<orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>If you are doing a source code build of Rice, it is in the directory <emphasis
                        role="bold">&lt;source root>/security</emphasis> and it has a file name of
                        <emphasis role="bold">rice.keystore</emphasis></para>
                <para><note><para>r1c3pw is the password used for the example provided.</para></note></para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The keystore is also located in the server distribution under the security
                    directory. </para>
                <para><note><para>keypass and storepass should be the same. r1c3pw is the password used for the
                    example provided</para></note></para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>You can generate the keystore yourself. Please refer to the KSB Technical
                    Reference Guide for the steps to accomplish this.</para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist></para>
    <section>
        <title>Configure KSB to use the keystore</title>
        <para>You must have these params in the xml config to allow KSB to use the keystore:</para>
        <para>
        <programlisting>
                &lt;param name="keystore.file">/usr/local/rice/rice.keystore&lt;/param>
                &lt;param name="keystore.alias">rice&lt;/param>
                &lt;param name="keystore.password">r1c3pw&lt;/param>
        </programlisting>
        </para>    
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>keystore.file - The location of the keystore</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>keystore.alias - The alias used in creating the keystore above</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>keystore.password - This is the password of the alias AND the keystore. This
                    assumes that the keystore is set up so that these are the same. </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
