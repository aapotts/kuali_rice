    <para>The Role document allows you to create a new KIM role and edit an existing role. Each role
        aggregates a specific set of permissions and responsibilities and allows you to assign
        members to the role. Rice and Rice Applications contain many existing roles that your
        institution may want to use as is, but you may also change existing roles and add new ones
        by using the Role document.</para>
    <para>The purpose of each role is defined by its associated permissions and responsibilities.
        Roles are classified by types that generally indicate the type of permissions and
        responsibilities with which they can be associated. </para>
    <note><para>The process of creating a new type requires technical assistance. Consequently, KIM does
        not provide an interface for creating role types.</para></note>

            <para>When you click the <emphasis role="bold">Create New</emphasis> button, the
                system displays the KIM Type Lookup. You must search for and select an existing
                Type in order for the system to generate a new Role document.</para>
            <note><para>Note that while the KIM Type Lookup is used when creating new groups and
                roles, not all KIM types are valid for both. When using this Lookup, you may
                receive different results depending on the KIM types that are valid for the
                entity you are working with.</para></note>

                                    that defines where the details of this workflow action request
                                    are defined. If the value is 'True' then action details will be
                                    collected when Members are assigned to the role. If the value is
                                    'False' then the action details must be collected when this
                                    responsibility is assigned to a role (see Assigning Action

                        required qualifiers from the nested role itself without qualifiers being
                        specified. You may always specify qualifying values for a nested role and
                        should do so unless you know the role being assigned contains logic to
                        derive the qualifiers from the nested role. Roles without the proper
                        qualifiers can cause problems throughout your applications. Please consult
                        with an application technical resource if you are unsure of whether or not
                        to provide qualifying values when assigning a role to another role.</para></caution>
