    <para>The Document Type document defines basic information about the document types that exist
        in KFS. It also defines document types specific to workflow and KIM. Many attributes of a
        document type not defined here are included in its workflow process definition and the data
        dictionary (a technical resource). The workflow process definition for a document type can
        be viewed using the Document Type lookup.</para>
    <para>Document Type documents can only be created by members of the KFS-SYS Manager or KR-SYS
        Technical Administrator roles and they do not route for approval.</para>

            <title>Fields Available for Retroactive Application Tab</title>
            <para>These are Document Type attributes that can be edited retroactively if need be.
                This means that should you decide to change one of these values for a given document
                type it is possible to apply the change retroactively to any documents of this type
                already created. For example, if you decided to change the Label of the Budget
                Adjustment document type you could choose that have that label change apply to
                historical Budget Adjustment documents in your KFS system.</para>
