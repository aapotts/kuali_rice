    <para>The Responsibility document allows you to create new responsibilities or edit existing
        ones. The Responsibility Lookup allows you to search for and view existing responsibilities.
        You can view summarized information about the responsibility detail values as well as the
        roles with which the responsibility is currently associated.</para>
    <para>Only members of a qualified, application specific role can create or modify a
        Responsibility document and it does not route for approval. Information about the
        Responsibility document follows detailed information about the Responsibility Lookup
        below.</para>
    <warning><para>Caution should be exercised when modifying existing responsibilities or adding new ones.
        Relatively minor changes can result in disruptions to the workflow of documents if made in
        error. Changes should be made only after sufficient testing with your local configuration. </para></warning>

                        a broad sense, what the responsibility is. Since responsibilities normally
                        are normally associated with action requests for user review, most

                            parent document type, which indicates that this responsibility applies

                            the value is 'True,' the system collects action details when members are
                            assigned to the role. If the value is 'False,' the system collects

                        <para>required: A True or False value that indicates whether the system is
                            required to generate an action request for this document type. If the
                            value is 'True' and the document generates no requests associated with
                            this responsibility, then the document will go into exception status. If

                            requests, then the document continues to route as normal.</para>
