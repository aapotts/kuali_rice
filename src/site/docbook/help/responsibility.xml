    <para>The Responsibility document allows you to create new responsibilities or edit existing
        ones. The Responsibility Lookup allows you to search for and view existing responsibilities.
        You can view summarized information about the responsibility detail values as well as the
        roles with which the responsibility is currently associated.</para>
    <para>Only members of the KFS-SYS Technical Administrator or KFS-SYS Manager role can create or
        modify a Responsibility document and it does not route for approval. Information about the
        Responsibility document follows detailed information about the Responsibility Lookup
        below.</para>
    <warning><para>Caution should be exercised when modifying existing responsibilities or adding new ones.
        Relatively minor changes can result in disruptions to the workflow of documents if made in
        error. Changes should be made only after sufficient testing with your local configuration. </para></warning>
