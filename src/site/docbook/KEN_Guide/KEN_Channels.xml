    <title>KEN Channels</title>
    <para>A KEN Channel is correlated to a specific type of notification. An example of a
        Channel's use may be to send out information about upcoming Library Events or broadcast
        general announcements on upcoming concerts. Channels are subscribed to in the act of
        receiving notifications from a publisher or producer. They can also be unsubscribed to
        and removed from the data store from within the UI. The Channel Definitions are stored
        in the database table KREN_CHNL_T. The columns are listed as follows:</para>
    <para>
        <table frame="none" tabstyle="striped">

        <title>Channel Subscription</title>
        <para>Subscribing to a notification channel causes all notifications sent on the channel
            to be delivered to the subscriber, regardless of the list of users or groups
            specified as recipients of the notification.</para>
        <para>Subscriptions are divided into two categories:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Subscribers</emphasis> – Users can subscribe to
                    any channel where the Subscription Flag is set to "Yes". </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Default Recipients</emphasis> – Each channel has a list
                        of users and groups that receive all channel notifications. To view the
                        complete list of default recipients for a channel, run the following query
                        replacing ? with your channel
                        id:<programlisting>SELECT * FROM KREN_RECIP_LIST_T
WHERE CHNL_ID = '?';</programlisting>
                    </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>Channels can be subscribed to through the UI and also through the direct access to
            the data store. To add a channel that can be subscribed to simply run the following
            SQL statement against the data store customizing value entries to your needs: </para>
        <programlisting>INSERT INTO KREN_CHNL_T (CHNL_ID,DESC_TXT,NM,SUBSCRB_IND,VER_NBR)
VALUES (2, 'This channel is used for sending out information about Library Events.', 'Library Events Channel', 'Y', 1)</programlisting>
        <para>To add default recipients to a channel, first locate the recipients through the Person Lookup 
            function as described <link xlink:href="http://site.kuali.org/rice/${project.version}/reference/html/KIM_Guide.html#KIM_Person">here</link> in the KIM Guide.</para>
        <para>Then, for each person's Principal ID, execute the following SQL where 'X' is the next
            RECIP_LIST_ID, 'Y' is the channel ID, and 'Z' is the Principal ID:
            <programlisting>INSERT INTO KREN_RECIP_LIST_T (RECIP_LIST_ID, CHNL_ID, RECIP_TYP_CD, RECIP_ID, OBJ_ID, VER_NBR)
VALUES ('X', 'Y', 'USER', 'Z', '', 1);  </programlisting></para>

        <title>Managing Subscribers</title>
        <para>Users can manage their subscriptions to channels where the Subscription Flag is
            <emphasis role="bold">Yes</emphasis> using the Channel Subscriptions form. On
            the Main Menu, click the <emphasis role="bold">Channel Subscriptions</emphasis> link
            in the <emphasis role="bold">Notification</emphasis> box:</para>

        <para>Click the <emphasis role="bold">Subscribe</emphasis> button for a channel to
            subscribe to a channel for which you are not already subscribed. Click the <emphasis
                role="bold">Unsubscribe</emphasis> button to cancel your subscription to the
            channel.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Notification Channel</title>
        <para>A notification channel is a communication stream used as a means to organize
            notifications by topic or audience. Users and groups can subscribe to a channel to
            receive the notifications that interest them.</para>
        <para>You can think of a notification channel as being like a television channel.
            Producers put messages on a channel, like producers at television stations air
            programs. Subscribers receive the messages, like television viewers watch the
            programs. Unlike a television program, a message sent on a channel will wait for you
            to read it; you do not need to be actively reading the channel to avoid missing a
            message.</para>
        <para>Each channel has the following attributes:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">ID</emphasis> – This numeric value is used in
                    various tables to identify the channel. Each channel must have a unique
                    ID, but there is no requirement for the IDs to be consecutive or to
                    start with a particular value. </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Name</emphasis> – This is the text displayed to
                    the user in the user interface. Each channel must have a unique name.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Description</emphasis> – This is text which
                    further describes the channel. </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Subscription Flag</emphasis> – This flag
                    identifies whether users can adjust their subscription status on the
                    channel. If "Yes", users can see the channel in the "Channel
                    Subscriptions" form and change their subscription status. If "No", a
                    user's subscription to the channel is managed by other means (for
                    example, group membership). </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Producers</emphasis> – This is a list of users
                    who are authorized to send notifications on the channel. </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Default Recipient List</emphasis> – This is a
                    list of users and groups who will receive notifications sent to the
                    channel, regardless of channel subscriptions or notification-specific
                    recipients. </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Reviewers</emphasis> – This is a list of users
                    who are responsible for approving notifications sent to the channel.
