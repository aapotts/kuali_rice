            <para xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Kuali's Rule Management System (KRMS)
                supports the creation, maintenance, storage and retrieval of business rules and
                agendas (ordered sets of business rules) within business contexts (e.g., for a
                particular department or for a particular university-wide process). </para>
            <para xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">KRMS enables you to define a set of
                rules within a particular business unit or for a particular set of applications.
                These business rules test for certain conditions and define the set of actions that
                result when conditions are met. KRMS enables you to call and use this logic from any
                application, without having to re-write and manage all the rules' logic within the
                application. </para>
            <para>KRMS takes advantage of several of the capabilities that KRAD makes available to
                all application developers.</para>

            <title>KRMS Agenda Editor</title>
            <para>Business rules in KRMS are placed into ordered sets called "agendas". The order of
                the rules in an agenda determines the sequencing, which rule gets evaluated first,
                second and so on, and the agenda also enables you to include conditional branching
                logic. </para>
            <para>In turn, agendas are placed into "contexts". You can set up contexts ro represent
                any categories that are relevant within your institution, for example they could be
                document types or business processes or any other categories. In some university
                environments, the following might be relevant contexts: Awards, Proposals, IRB
                reviews, Course co-requisites, Course pre-requisites, Student plan evaluations, and
                so on.   </para>
            <para>Each defined context contains its own agendas, and each agenda contains its own
                rules. Rules aren't shared across agendas (though you can copy/paste, they become
                unique rule instances), and agendas aren't shared across contexts. There is no
                context hierarchy, that is, agendas and rules can't be inherited across contexts
                within any sort of hierarchy. </para>
            <para>See below for a view of the Agenda Editor in KRMS.</para>

            <para>And see below for an example of how attributes can be progressively rendered in
                KRMS.  In this example, the type of "CampusAgendaType" requires some additional
                attributes, that are not required by all types.  These are shown to the end user
                only when required.  This is an example of KRAD's progressive disclosure capability: </para>

            <para>Each defined agenda in KRMS contains its own rules. Rules aren't shared across
                agendas (though you can copy/paste, they become unique rule instances), and agendas
                aren't shared across contexts. There is no context hierarchy, that is, agendas and
                rules can't be inherited across contexts within any sort of hierarchy. </para>
