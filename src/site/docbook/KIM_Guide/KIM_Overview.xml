    <title>KIM Overview</title>
    
    <para>Kuali Identity Management (KIM) provides identity and access
        management services to Rice and other applications. All KIM services are
        available on the service bus with both SOAP endpoints. KIM provides a
        service layer and a set of GUIs that you can use to maintain the identity
        information.</para>
    <para>KIM is designed to be used with both Kuali and non-Kuali
        applications. The permissions and responsibilities it provides are defined
        by each user's Role or Roles in the system. Roles can be customized to
        handle permissions and responsibilities in a variety of ways based on your
        particular needs.</para>
