        <para>Similar to the Permission Lookup, you can use the Responsibility
            Lookup to search for and view existing responsibilities in KIM. You can
            view summarized information about the responsibility detail values as
            well as the roles with which the responsibility is currently
            associated.</para>

                            pertain to workflow, most responsibility templates are
                            associated with the KR-WKFLW (Kuali Rice-Workflow)

                            A template usually defines, in a broad sense, what the
                            responsibility is. Since responsibilities normally are
                            associated with action requests for user review, most
                            responsibilities have a template name of "Review."</entry>

                            module this responsibility is associated with. This code
                            usually corresponds to the namespace of the document type for
                            which the responsibility generates action requests.</entry>

                            responsibility names are not unique.</entry>
