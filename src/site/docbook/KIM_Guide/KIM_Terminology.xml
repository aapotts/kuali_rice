        <title>Principal</title>
        
        <para>A principal represents an entity that can authenticate. In
            essence, you can think of a principal as an "account" or as an entity's
            authentication credentials. A principal has an ID that is used to
            uniquely identify it. It also has a name that represents the principal's
            username and is typically what is entered when authenticating. All
            principals are associated with one and only one entity.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <title>Entity</title>
        
        <para>An entity represents a person or system. Additionally, other
            "types" of entities can be defined in KIM. Information like name, phone
            number, etc. is associated with an entity. While an entity will
            typically have a single principal associated with it, it is possible for
            an entity to have more than one principal or even no principals at all
            (in the case where the entity does not actually authenticate).</para>
        
        <para>Entities have numerous attributes associated with them,
            including:<itemizedlist>

    <section>
        <title>Group</title>
        
        <para>A group is a collection of principals. You can create a group
            using both direct principal assignment and nested group membership. All
            groups are uniquely identified by a namespace code plus a name. A
            principal or group is a "member" of a group if it is either directly
            assigned to the group or indirectly assigned (through a nested group
            membership). A principal or group is a "direct" member of another group
            only if it is directly assigned as a member of the group, and not
            through a nested group assignment.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <title>Permission</title>
        
        <para>A permission is the ability to perform an action. All permissions
            have a permission template. Both permissions and permission templates
            are uniquely identified by a namespace code plus a name. The permission
            template defines the coarse-grained permission and specifies what
            additional permission details need to be collected on permissions that
            use that template. For example, a permission template might have a name
            of "Initiate Document," which requires a permission detail specifying
            the document type that can be initiated. A permission created from the
            "Initiate Document" template would define the name of the specific
            Document Type that can be initiated as a permission detail.</para>
        
        <para>The <emphasis role="bold">isAuthorized</emphasis> and <emphasis
            role="bold">isAuthorizedByTemplateName</emphasis> operations on the
            <emphasis role="bold">PermissionService</emphasis> are used to execute
            authorization checks for a principal against a permission. Permissions
            are always assigned to roles (never directly to a principal or group). A
            particular principal will be authorized for a given permission if the
            principal is assigned to a role that has been granted the
            permission.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <title>Responsibility</title>
        
        <para>A responsibility represents an action that a principal is
            requested to take. This is used for defining workflow actions (such as
            approve, acknowledge, FYI) for which the principal is responsible.
            Responsibilities form the basis of the workflow engine routing
            process.</para>
        
        <para>A responsibility is very similar to a permission in a couple of
            ways. First, responsibilities are always granted to a role, never
            assigned directly to a principal or group. Furthermore, similar to
            permissions, a role has a responsibility template. The responsibility
            template specifies what additional responsibility details need to be
            defined when the responsibility is created.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <title>Role</title>
        
        <para>You grant permissions and responsibilities to roles. Roles have a
            membership consisting of principals, groups, and/or other roles. As a
            member of a role, the associated principal has all permissions and
            responsibilities that have been granted to that role.</para>
        
        <para>You can specify a qualification to any membership assignment on
            the role, which is extra information about that particular member of the
            role. For example, a person may have the role of "Dean" but that can be
            further qualified by the school they are the dean of, such as "Computer
            Science." You can pass qualifications as part of authorization checks to
            restrict the subset of roles to check.</para>
