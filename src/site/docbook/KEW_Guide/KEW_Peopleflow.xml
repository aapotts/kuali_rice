    <title>PeopleFlow - a new KEW feature</title>
    <para>PeopleFlow is our Kuali Rice instantiation of the "maps" concept included in the
        original Coeus. For all intents and purposes it's a prioritized list of people to send
        requests to.   Essentially, it's like a mini people-based workflow that doesn't require
        you to specify a KEW node in the document type for each individual who might need to
        approve or be notified. You can define "Stops" in a PeopleFlow, where everything in the
        same stop proceeds in parallel, but all must be done within the stop before proceeding
        to the next stop. </para>
    <para>You can call/execute a PeopleFlow from within a KEW workflow node directly, or you can
        invoke the <link xlink:href="http://site.kuali.org/rice/${project.version}/reference/html/KRMS_Guide.html">Kuali Rules Management System (KRMS)</link>engine from an application and any
        PeopleFlows that get selected during rule execution, defined in a KRMS agenda, will be
        called. In this way, you can integrate business rules across applications and workflows. </para>
    <para>The same PeopleFlow that defines a routing order among a set of persons, groups or
        roles can be called by KRMS rules, with the KRMS rules defining which type of  request
        to pass to the PeopleFlow (for example, an "approval" routing action or a
        "notification").   </para>
    <para>KRMS is also a new feature in Rice 2.0.  See the KRMS Users' Guide for more
        information on KRMS.  </para>

        <title>Creating a new PeopleFlow</title>
        <para>You can define a PeopleFlow (simple workflow) via a maintenance document.  In the
            Kuali Rice portal on the main tab there is a Workflow category, and PeopleFlow is in
            that category.  Select it:  </para>

        </para>
        <para>You can search for a PeopleFlow to copy from and modify (be sure to give it a new
            unique name) or can create a new one (see the top right of the lookup screen).</para>

        </para>
        <para>The view below shows that some sections are collapsed, and also shows additional
            attributes that are required based on the user's selection of a type. This is an example
            of the Kuali Rapid Application Development (KRAD) framework's support of progressive
            disclosure, only showing these additional type attribute fields if/when they are
            required:</para>

            </figure>   
        </para>
        <para>PeopleFlows that you create can be called by rules, with the rules determining
            whether the PeopleFlow will be called for an action (such as approvals) or for
            notifications.  These PeopleFlows (similar to the Coeus concept of "maps") can be
            integrated with the new Kuali Rules Management System (KRMS), with KEW workflows, or
            with other custom-built applications.</para>
