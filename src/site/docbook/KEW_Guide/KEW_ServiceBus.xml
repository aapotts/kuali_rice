        <title>KEW Usage of the Kuali Service Bus</title>
    <section>
        <title>General Usage</title>
        <para>The Kuali Enterprise Workflow engine makes use of both synchronous service
            endpoints and asynchronous messaging features from the Kuali Service Bus.</para>
        <para>Most asynchronous processing that KEW does is implemented using asynchronous
            messaging on the service bus. This includes:<orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Workflow engine processing </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Blanket approval orchestration </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Action processing for actions taken directly from the Action List
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Re-resolving actions requests resulting from a responsibility change
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Sending email reminders </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Distributed cache flush notifications </para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist></para>
        <para>In each of these cases, there exists a service that processes asynchronous
            messages and performs the appropriate actions for each of these functions.</para>
        <para>In terms of synchronous services, Kuali Enterprise Workflow publishes two
            different types of services. One is used for performing workflow document actions
            (such as creating, approving, disapproving, etc.). The other is used to perform
            various query or read-only operations against the workflow system.</para>

        <title>Implications of using "Synchronous" KSB messaging with KEW</title>
        <para>For general information on synchronous messaging and its implications in the KSB,
            please read "Implications of synchronous vs. asynchronous Message Deliver" in the
            KSB technical reference guide.</para>
        <para>In terms of Kuali Enterprise Workflow, the usage of synchronous messing means that
            operations like workflow engine processing will happen immediately and synchronously
            at the time it's invoked.</para>
        <para>The main implication here besides what is listed in the KSB documentation is that,
            since message exception handling isn't implemented, exception routing does not work
            when using synchronous KSB messaging.</para>
        <para>This means that if this messaging model is being used in a batch job, or similar
            type of program, routing exceptions will need to be manually caught. If it's desired
            to place a document into exception status from here, there are methods on the KEW
            APIs to do this manually.</para>
