    <title>Using the Workflow Document API</title>
    <section>
        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>This document explains features of the workflow document API. There are two
            interfaces in KEW that allow you to create a document for delivery through workflow.
            The <emphasis role="bold">WorkflowDocument</emphasis> interface is designed to
            create a new document in the workflow system once an action has been taken, such as
            sending ad hoc requests. The <emphasis role="bold">WorkflowInfo</emphasis> interface
            is actually a convenience class for client applications that query workflow. Both
            classes assist with implementing connections to KEW. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>WorkflowDocument</title>
        <para>The process for this section of the API involves creating the initial <emphasis
            role="bold">WorkflowDocument</emphasis> using a constructor to create a new
            routable document in KEW. Once the object is defined, it initializes by loading an
            existing <emphasis role="italic">routeHeaderId</emphasis> or by constructing an
            empty document of a specified <emphasis role="italic">documentType</emphasis>. A
            number of methods can be invoked once initialization is complete and details of how
            those methods would be invoked are outlined primarily in the Java Documentation at
            <link xlink:href="https://test.kuali.org/rice/rice-api-1.0-javadocs/"
                >https://test.kuali.org/rice/rice-api-1.0-javadocs/</link>.</para>
        <para>Document content methods modify the properties of a document's content. A specific
            case is <emphasis role="italic">addAttributeDefinition()</emphasis>, where a
            <emphasis role="italic">WorkflowAttribute</emphasis> is used to generate
            attribute document content that will be appended to the existing document content.
            Another case is adding a searchable attribute definition with the <emphasis
                role="italic">addSearchableDefinition()</emphasis> method. More information on
            the various constructors, methods, and objects relating to the WorkflowDocument
            class is available in the Java documentation found at <link
                xlink:href="https://test.kuali.org/rice/rice-api-1.0-javadocs/org/kuali/rice/kew/service/WorkflowDocument.html"
                >https://test.kuali.org/rice/rice-api-1.0-javadocs/org/kuali/rice/kew/service/WorkflowDocument.html</link>. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>WorkflowInfo</title>
        <para>This class is the second client interface to KEW. The first time this object is
            initialized, the client configuration is accessed to determine how to connect to
            KEW. Methods invoked from this class can grab the routing header information based
            on the principleId, or return a set of Action Requests for a document that's in
            route based on the <emphasis role="italic">routeHeaderId</emphasis>, the <emphasis
                role="italic">nodeName</emphasis> and the <emphasis role="italic"
                    >principalId</emphasis>. More information on the various constructors, methods,
            and objects relating to the <emphasis role="italic">WorkflowInfo</emphasis> class is
            available in the Java documentation found at <link
                xlink:href="https://test.kuali.org/rice/rice-api-1.0-javadocs/org/kuali/rice/kew/service/WorkflowInfo.html"
