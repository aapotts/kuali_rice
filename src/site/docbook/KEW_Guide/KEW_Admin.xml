    <title>KEW Administration Guide</title>
    <para>This guide provides information on administering a Kuali Enterprise Workflow (KEW)
        installation. Out of the box, KEW comes with a default setup that works well in
        development and test environments. However, when moving to a production environment,
        this setup requires adjustments. This document discusses basic administration as well as
        instructions for working with some of KEW's administration tools.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Configuration Overview</title>
        <para>You configure KEW primarily through the <emphasis role="bold"
            >workflow.xml</emphasis> file. Please see the KEW Configuration Parameters guide
            for more information on initial configuration of a KEW installation.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Application Constants</title>
        <para>Application Constants are the configuration elements in KEW. Each constant is
            modifiable at system runtime; any changes take effect immediately in KEW.
            Application Constants are stored in a cluster-safe cache and propagated across all
            machines when change occurs. For more information about Application Constants,
            please refer to Application Constants.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Production Environments</title>
        <para>When rolling KEW out into a production environment, there are application
            constants which you may need to change:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">ActionList.sendEmailNotification</emphasis> -
                        This is usually set to false in test environments so emails aren't
                        generated during testing. Usually, this is set this to true in a
                        production environment to allow email notifications. You also need to
                        ensure that your email service is configured properly to allow KEW to
                        send notifications. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">ApplicationContext</emphasis> - In a production
                        environment, this is usually something like en-prd. You must set this
                        value correctly so that KEW's email notifications contain valid links.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Backdoor.ShowbackDoorLogin</emphasis> - The
                        backdoor login allows users to masquerade as other users for testing
                        purposes. It is recommended that you set this value to false in a
                        production environment. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">RouteManagerPool.numWorkers</emphasis> â€“ The
                        appropriate value for this depends on the capabilities of your
                        production hardware. If it's set too high, KEW may use so much of the
                        CPU that other applications running on the same machine are adversely
                        impacted. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">RouteManagerQueue.waitTime</emphasis> - In test
                        environments, users tend to be more sensitive to immediate feedback
                        since they may be testing processes over the course of a couple minutes
                        that, in practice, occur over a number of days. In test environments, it
                        is recommended that you keep this value low. In a production
                        environment, you can reasonably increase this value without affecting
                        the speed at which documents are routed. This reduces thrashing on the
                        route queue. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">RouteQueue.isRoutingByIPNumber</emphasis> - If
                        you are running your production KEW system in a clustered environment,
                        set this value to false. This allows processing of documents in the
                        queue to be distributed across the entire cluster, which enhances
                        routing performance and facilitates load balancing. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">RouteQueue.maxRetryAttempts</emphasis> - As with
                        the <emphasis role="italic">RouteManagerQueue.waitTime</emphasis>
                        constant, in a test environment it is important to find out as quickly
                        as possible if a document is going to go into exception routing (usually
                        indicating a problem in that document's routing setup). In a production
                        environment, it may make sense to allow a longer period before a
                        document goes into exception routing. This constant, in combination with
                        the <emphasis role="italic">RouteQueue.timeIncrement</emphasis>
                        constant, determines how long it takes a document to be put into
                        exception routing. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">RouteQueue.timeIncrement</emphasis> - Increasing
                        this value results in a longer time before a document goes into
                        exception routing. </para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>XML Ingestion</title>
        <para>KEW relies on XML for data population and routing configuration. <emphasis
            role="bold">XML Ingester</emphasis> is available from the <emphasis role="bold"
                >Administrator</emphasis> channel in the portal. This allows import of various
            KEW components from XML, such as DocumentTypes, RuleAttributes, Rules, Workgroups,
            and more.</para>

        <title>Message Queue Administration</title>
        <para>The Message Queue is the main scheduling mechanism in KEW. You use it to schedule
            documents for asynchronous routing and to queue arbitrary units of work. When KEW
            places a document into exception routing, it may become stuck after a series of
            failed attempts. You can use the Route Queue UI to resolve this issue, as well as to
            fix new entries, if needed.</para>
