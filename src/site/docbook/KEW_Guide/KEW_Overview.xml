        <section>
            <title>What is workflow, in general?</title>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Workflow</emphasis> is a very general term and means
                different things in different contexts. For example, it may mean the sequence of
                approvals needed for a Leave Request or it may refer to a complex scientific
                procedure. </para>
            <para>In our context of enterprise applications within a higher education institution,
                we're usually talking about business process management when we discuss workflow.
                Usually, this revolves around business rules, authorizations, and routing for
                approval.</para>
            <para>A simple example is a leave request system. It needs some workflow to get the
                necessary people (supervisor, etc.) to approve it. This is one example of the
                routing and approval side of a workflow.</para>
            <para>You may also have business rules in workflow that dictate that some people get
                automatic approval for leave requests. This is a business rule detail that workflow
                executes by automatically routing these types of requests past the approval
                steps.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>What is Kuali Enterprise Workflow, in particular?</title>
            <para>The Kuali Enterprise Workflow (KEW) product revolves around routing and approval
                of documents. It is a stand-alone <emphasis role="italic">workflow engine</emphasis>
                upon which you can integrate other enterprise applications to do routing and
                approvals.</para>
            <para>In addition, KEW contains an <emphasis role="bold">eDocLite</emphasis> system.
                This is a mechanism to create simple data-entry forms directly in KEW. You can also
                create routing rules around eDocLite forms. eDocLite forms are the rough equivalent
                of the basic, one- or two-page forms that are commonly used to process business and
                get signature approvals. </para>
            <para>The benefit of eDocLite in KEW is that it does <emphasis role="italic"
                >not</emphasis> require a separate application. You can use eDocLite in KEW
                simply by setting up the forms that your institution or department needs.</para>
            <para>Overall, KEW is based on documents. In KEW, each document has a collection of
                transactions or <emphasis role="italic">things to be done</emphasis>. Each
                transaction is approved or denied individually in KEW.</para>
            <para>For example, John Doe may use a <emphasis role="italic">Leave Request</emphasis>
                document in KEW to ask for a week off in June. The KEW Leave Request document
                contains enough information for his supervisor to make a decision about John's
                leave. (The document may use data keys to retrieve external information, such as
                John's past Leave Requests and available hours.) Once John submits his Leave
                Request, KEW routes it to John's supervisor for approval. Depending on how John's
                department has configured KEW for routing Leave Requests, after John's supervisor
                approves or denies his request, KEW may route it to more people for further action
                to be taken.</para>
            <para>Once John's Leave Request document is processed, it triggers a <emphasis
                role="bold">PostProcessor</emphasis>, which can perform any desired additional
                processing. This is most commonly used to "finalize" the business transaction once
                all approvers have signed off on it. In this particular example, it might call
                another service that would update records in the Leave Request application's
                database, indicating that the individual has successfully scheduled leave during
                that time period. </para>
            <para>In addition, the KEW <emphasis role="bold">PostProcessor</emphasis> contains hooks
                for all the stages that a document goes through. For example, an external
                application may use a KEW workflow for routing and approval of documents, and that
                application may take action at each change in state of a routed document.</para>

            <title>What problems or functions does KEW solve? </title>
            <para>The primary benefit of KEW workflow is the correct routing for approval of
                documents. It enforces your business-specific rules about who needs to approve what
                documents, in which scenarios.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Simple Workflow Example</emphasis></para>
            <para>Leave Request: Each person has one other person (possibly more) who needs to
                approve his or her leave requests. In this context, KEW is the system that
                manages both the approval structure and the leave requests themselves (the
                actual approvals).</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">More Complex Workflow Example</emphasis></para>
            <para>Purchasing Desktop Computers: You may need several business rules in KEW for
                this, such as a rule to enforce:<orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>A strategic alliance requires that you buy from one vendor unless
                            there is a justification to not do so </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>General purchasing approval by the Purchasing Department is
                            required when the cost of the purchase exceeds a certain limit
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Approval by the account owners who fund the purchase is required
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </orderedlist></para>
            <para>In this example, KEW requires an approval if:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The strategic alliance is not used </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The cost limit for Purchasing Department approval is exceeded
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
            <para>The workflow also requires an approval by the signer (or delegate) for each
                spending account that you use for the purchase.</para>
            <para>In KEW, <emphasis role="bold">Approval Types</emphasis> are set up such as account
                approver, supervisor, or organizational/department hierarchy approver. An Approval
                Type contains the applicable routing and approval rules. Once you create an approval
                type, those routing and approval rules are available for other workflow clients and
                scenarios. This creates a <emphasis role="italic">tipping point</emphasis>
                situation, in which the more applications and business processes you set up through
                workflow, the easier it gets to do new ones.</para>
            <para>In addition, KEW can help you with distributed management of approval structures.
                Each group at your institution (each college, unit, division, etc.) can create their
                own approval and workflow structure for their group, and you can centrally manage
                the workflow above those groups. This allows groups to manage their own internal
                controls and structures, while still being subject to higher-level institutional
                controls.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>What problems does KEW NOT solve?</title>
            <para>KEW is not a general-purpose application builder. For complex applications, you
                need to develop applications separately and then integrate them with KEW. For simple
                forms or documents that need approval, you can use <emphasis role="bold"
                    >eDocLite</emphasis>, but this only works in simple cases, analogous to a one-
                or two-page paper form that requires signatures. It is important to note, however,
                that Kuali Rice does include a framework called the Kuali Nervous System (KNS) that
                can be used to facilitate the development of more complex applications and includes
                built-in integration with KEW.</para>
            <para>KEW is not a general-purpose business rules engine. For example, it does not know
                that a continuation account must be specified when an account is closed. Those types
                of rules are the responsibility of the application itself to manage. However, this
                is not a clear-cut line, as KEW does manage business rules that directly affect
                routing and approval.</para>
            <para>KEW is not an Organization Hierarchy manager. For example, it will not
                automatically manage your organizational hierarchies and internal structures.
                However, integration with these hierarchies and structures can be accomplished using
                KEW, and leveraging such hierarchies for routing and approval is a very common need
                for many applications.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>With which applications can KEW integrate?</title>
            <para>Nearly anything, in theory. In the current version of KEW, any application can
                access KEW if it can:<itemizedlist>

        <section>
            <title> Can I use KEW without building an entire application?</title>
            <para>Yes, absolutely! </para>
            <para>KEW is an incredibly powerful platform for routing and approval for enterprise
                (i.e., large) applications. However, it also includes <emphasis role="bold"
                    >eDocLite</emphasis>, which makes it easy to develop simple business-process
                forms and run them through KEW. In this situation, in its most simple form, you can
                do all of your work within KEW, and most of that work is in developing your form
                configurations. If needed, the eDocLite process can also hook into a post-processor
                to take an action once a document's approvals are complete.</para>

    <title>Kuali Enterprise Workflow: Overview</title>
    <para>Kuali Enterprise Workflow, or KEW, is a module of Kuali Rice. KEW provides useful
        features for automatically sending documents to people for approval or action using
        workflows, managing the documents you receive through these workflows, searching for
        documents, and checking information about documents that have been in a workflow. KEW is
        built by and for higher education institutions and is especially designed for
        automatically routing work across departmental boundaries.</para>

        <title>What is KEW?</title>
        <para>Kuali Enterprise Workflow provides a common routing and approval engine that
            facilitates the automation of electronic processes across the enterprise. The
            workflow product was built by and for higher education, so it is particularly well
            suited to route mediated transactions across departmental boundaries. Workflow
            facilitates distribution of processes out into the organizations to eliminate paper
            processes and shadow feeder systems. In addition to facilitating routing and
            approval, workflow can also automate process to process related flows. Each process
            instance is assigned a unique identifier that is global across the organization.
            Workflow keeps a permanent record of all processes and their participants.</para>
