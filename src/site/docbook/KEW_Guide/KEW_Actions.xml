            <para>In the Kuali Rice portal, the Action List button is available in the upper

            <para>Your institution may have KEW links inside other applications, such as Kuali
                Financial Systems (KFS). KFS may display an Action List button at the top left
                of the KFS page like this:</para>

            <para>Clicking an Action List link or button displays your <emphasis role="bold"
                    >Action List</emphasis> page. This is a sample KEW Action List; your
                institution's may look somewhat different:</para>
            <para>On your Action List page is the list of documents on which you need to take an
                action, such as Approve, Disapprove, or Acknowledge, and those which you have
                already completed. These are your action requests. Action requests that someone
                has delegated to you are also listed on your Action List page. Note: You can
                only see the Action List for the person who is logged into KEW or another Kuali
                application.</para>
            <para>You can click the title at the top of a column to sort all of your action
                requests by the information in that column. For example, if you click the column
                title, Type, KEW sorts your action requests by their Type.</para>
            <para>On your Action List, you can see this information about the documents on which
                you need to take action:<itemizedlist>

                        <para><emphasis role="bold">Id</emphasis>: A unique, system-generated ID

                                    <para>When you click a Document Id, KEW displays the actions
                                        you can take on this document, such as Blanket Approve,
                                        Complete, Approve, Disapprove, and Cancel. The actions
                                        you can take are determined by the document's Type.

                                        to see a summary of the document. </para>

                                        the document can cancel it after routing begins. When a

                                        The secondary delegate acts as a temporary backup and
                                        has the same authority as the delegator when the
                                        delegator is not available to take action. Documents
                                        appear in the Action Lists of both the delegator and the
                                        delegate. When either acts on the document, it
                                        disappears from both Action Lists. People often have a
                                        secondary delegate who takes care of their action

                <para>If enabled for a particular document, messages can also be logged through

                other message that will be reflected in the routing without taking an action on
                the document.</para>
            <para>This function is enabled by KIM permissions. These permissions have template
                'Add Message to Route Log' which takes a document type name as a detail. The
                bootstrap dataset contains one permission with this template and document type
                detail 'KualiDocument', however this permission is not granted to any role. This
                means the functionality will be disabled until the permission is assigned or
                another permission record with this template and for another document type is
                created and assigned. When matching permissions for a particular document type
                the document type hierarchy is considered. Permission records for children
                document types will override any permission record for its parents.</para>
            <para>For example, if we wanted to enable the feature on all KualiDocuments except
                document type 'Foo', we would first grant the permission with document type
                detail 'KualiDocument' to a role. Then we would create an additional permission
                with template 'Add Message to Route Log' and document type detail 'Foo'. For the
                second permission we do not assign any roles. </para>
            <para>By granting these permission(s) to one of the derived workflow roles we can
                enable this feature to users who have active routing requests. Examples of such
                roles are KR-WKFLW Approve Request Recipient and KR-WKFLW Acknowledge Request
                Recipient.</para>

            <para>However, adding a 'Document Type Notification' that is different from 
                the 'Default Email Notification,' forces the document-type notification to take 
                precedence. This allows users to customize by document- type for email reminders. 
                For example:<itemizedlist>

                    <listitem><para>If 'Daily' is the 'Default Email Notification,' and a document-type rule

            <para>When an action request is received, and the preference is set to receive an immediate reminder, the system

            <para>This allows these checkboxes to be used as a switch to 'turn-on or turn-off' the "immediate" email 
                reminders for a given request type. For example:<itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para>To stop the receipt of Acknowledgement emails when your preference is set to

        <section>
            <title>Overview</title>
            <para>Action Requests are one of the core functions of the Kuali Enterprise Workflow
                (KEW) system. An Action Request is a call from KEW to a person or group to take
                action on a document. Action Requests are created when the system or a person routes
                (sends) a document to another user and ask that user to do something with the
                document. You might ask someone to approve an expense, for example, or to
                acknowledge that he or she received a copy of an expense report. </para>
            <para>Once an Action Request has been created in KEW, the associated document is sent to
                the appropriate users' action lists. A user can open his or her Action List and from
                there, view information about the document, open the document, and/or take the
                requested action. If a user takes an action, for example, approves or disapproves a
                document, that is called an Action Taken.</para>
            <para>The path that the document takes from its starting point to final approval is
                called its route. Each point along that path where a person needs to do something
                with the document (approve, acknowledge, etc.) is called a node on the route.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Types of Action Requests</title>
            <para>Each action request has one row on your Action List. There are five types of
                Action Requests:</para>

            <title>Action Request Hierarchies</title>
            <para>In certain situations, you can use roles for action requests and you can delegate
                action requests. You can think of these as trees or as a parent action request that
                has children action requests.</para>
            <para>Roles are groups of Principals or Groups that KEW creates based on rules your
                institution sets up. Since KEW can only create an action request for a single person
                or group but a role may have several people or groups in it, KEW creates an action
                request for the role (a parent request), and that action request creates child
                action requests that go to each person or group in that role. </para>
            <para>The parent role request can have any number of children requests that are each
                either a user request or a group request.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Action Request Delegation</title>
                <para>In KEW, you may delegate, or give, your request authority to other people. For
                    example, if Joe is the fiscal officer for an account but he doesn't actually
                    approve documents, he may delegate his approval authority to Jane. Both Joe and
                    Jane can now take actions on Joe's action requests</para>
                <para>If Jane approves a document as Joe's delegate, Joe's action request is
                    satisfied. If Joe approves the document, Jane's action request is satisfied.

                <para>You can combine a role request with a delegate. In fact, in the previous
                    example, the action request that is sent to Joe as a fiscal officer is really a
                    role request. The action request tree for that scenario is:</para>

                <para>When action requests are created, they are in the Initialized state. They stay in
                    this state until KEW determines that they need to be Activated. When a request

                <para>During request activation, if the Ignore Previous flag is false and KEW determines
                    that a previous action satisfies the current request, it will Deactivate the request
                    instead of Activating it. Activation begins at a root request, but Deactivation
                    begins at the request where KEW finds that a satisfying action has occurred if that
                    request is set to not ignore previous actions.</para>
                <note>
                    <para>Action request structures can be hierarchical. Activation of requests always
                        starts at the parent request and works down the tree, activating each level of the
                        tree in turn. </para>
                    <para>Roles can have an All Approve policy. All Approve means that all members of a role
                        must approve the document before the entire request is deactivated. (See
                        Deactivation below.)</para>

                <title>Deactivation</title>
                <para>When a user takes action on a document, that action may start the deactivation
                    of other action requests on the document. For example, if Joe has a pending
                    request and he takes an Approve action on it, his request is deactivated.
                    Request deactivation changes the status of the request from Initialized or
                    Activated to Deactivated. </para>
                <para>If Joe's action taken causes other action requests to be Deactivated, his
                    action taken is associated with all of the requests that it Deactivates. </para>
                <para>Unlike Activation, Deactivation always starts at the request that was
                    satisfied by the action taken. For example, if Joe is delegating to Jane and
                    Jane issues an Approve action on her request, Deactivation starts at Jane's
                    request. However, if Joe issues the Approve action, Deactivation starts at the
                    parent. </para>

                <para>If there are no roles set to "All Approve" on an action request, one action
                    can Deactivate the entire request tree. This is because KEW works up and down
                    the tree, Deactivating requests as it goes.</para>
                <para>However, when there is an "All Approve" role, requests for all parties within
                    the role must be Deactivated before the parent role request is Deactivated. For
                    example, if we have an "All Approve" role request with three children requests,
                    when one of the users takes action, their request is Deactivated, but since
                    there are two other requests that still need to be satisfied, the Deactivation
                    cannot go back to the parent role request. When the last of the three users has
                    taken action, the parent role request is Deactivated.</para>

            <para>Actions are how a user interacts with KEW. Actions can be performed in response to
                an Action Request (such as an Approve action) or they can be user-initiated (such as
                the routing of a document). Most, but not all, actions create Action Takens. The
                Action Taken is recorded on the Route Log and associated with a satisfied action
                request, where appropriate.</para>

                <para>Use this action to satisfy an Acknowledge action request. When you take an
                    Acknowledge action, it usually means that you have examined the document.

                <para>When you take an Acknowledge action, KEW finds all pending acknowledge

                    records an Acknowledge Action Taken and associates it with the Deactivated
                    requests. You may take an Acknowledge action even if you have no Acknowledge

                <title>Blanket Approve Action</title>
                <para>Use the Blanket Approve action to force a document to complete a set of action
                    requests. This allows certain users to "push" a document through its routing. To
                    take this action, you must have the appropriate KIM Permission (or be in the
                    Blanket Approve Group which is set in the Document Type, but that is a
                    deprecated feature). Unless you select a specific node (point in the document's
                    routing path) when you take a Blanket Approve Action, KEW finds all pending
                    Approve or Complete requests at the current level in the request tree and
                    Deactivates them. It records a Blanket Approve Action Taken and associates it
                    with each of the Deactivated requests.</para>
                <para>Then, KEW sends Acknowledge action requests to each person whose action
                    request was satisfied by the Blanket Approve. It does this for all levels in the
                    request tree until it reaches the end point set in the Blanket Approve Action or
                    it reaches the end of the request tree.</para>

                <para>Use this action when a document is no longer valid and you need to cancel it.
                    You must have a pending Approve or Complete action request on the document
                    before you can Cancel it. Cancelling a document is similar to Disapproving it
                    except that the Cancel action does not send out notifications.</para>
                <para>When you take a Cancel action, KEW finds all pending requests on the document
                    and Deactivates them. It records a Cancel Action Taken and associates it with
                    the Deactivated requests. Then it sets the document's status to CANCELLED and
                    the document is effectively dead.</para>

                <title>Clear FYI Action</title>
                <para>Use this action to satisfy an FYI action request. You usually get an FYI just
                    to notify you about a document. You don't need to take any action on an FYI
                    request, but if you want to remove that FYI and document from your Action List,
                    take the Clear FYI action.</para>
                <para>When you take the Clear FYI action KEW locates all pending FYI requests on
                    this document that are routed to you and Deactivates them. It then records an
                    FYI Action Taken. You must have a pending FYI request on a document to use the
                    Clear FYI action.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Complete Action</title>
                <para>Use this action to satisfy an Approve or Complete action request. When you use
                    a Complete, it means that you have looked at the document and completed any of
                    the necessary information on the document so it can proceed. Complete action
                    requests are typically created as the result of a Save action or in response to
                    an Exception Routing request.</para>
                <para>When you use the Complete action KEW finds all pending Approve or Complete
                    requests that are routed to you and Deactivates them. If the document is in the
                    Exception state, it changes it back to Enroute. It then records a Complete
                    Action Taken. You may take a Complete action even if you have no Complete or
                    Approve action requests.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Create Document Action</title>
                <para>This action creates a new document in KEW of the chosen Document Type. This
                    action does not record an Action Taken of any sort but simply begins a new
                    document and assigns a document ID to it. The document begins in Initiated
                    status. The Document type determines how the document is routed and what must be
                    done for it. For example, an expense report might be routed (sent) to two or
                    three different people for approval before it is paid.</para>

                <title>Disapprove Action</title>
                <para>When you have an Approve action request, you use a Disapprove action if the
                    document does not meet the approval criteria. You must have a pending Approve or
                    Complete request on the document before you can Disapprove it. Disapproving a
                    document is similar to Cancelling it, except that Disapproval sends out
                    notifications.</para>
                <para>When you Disapprove a document, KEW finds all pending requests on the document
                    and Deactivates them. Next, it creates Acknowledge notification requests to all
                    users that had Approve or Complete action requests at the current node and all
                    previous nodes. It also sends an Acknowledge notification request to the
                    initiator of the document. Then the document's status is set to Disapproved and
                    the document is effectively dead.</para>

                <title>Log Document Action</title>
                <para>This action simply enters a message on the document. It records an Action
                    Taken but it is never associated with any action requests. This action displays
                    a message on the document in the Route Log.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Move Document Action</title>
                <para>This action moves a document either backward in the route path or forward.
                    Moving the document backward works like the Return to Previous Node action and
                    moving the document forward works like a Blanket Approve action. The difference
                    between these is that the Action Taken is recorded as a Move action. </para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Return to Previous Node Action</title>
                <para>Use this action to move a document to a previous node in the route. You must
                    have a pending Approve or Complete request on the document before you can use
                    this action.</para>
                <para>When you use this action, KEW Deactivates all pending requests on the document
                    and sets the current node on the document to the previous node that you
                    requested (this is called the target node). It records a Return to Previous Node
                    Action Taken and associates it with the Deactivated requests. Any requests on
                    nodes between the current node and the target node are removed, effectively
                    erasing them. KEW then sends the document through again to recreate requests on
                    the target node. This way a document is "returned" to a previous node, rolling
                    it back to its previous state at that point in the route.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Route Document Action</title>
                <para>Use the Route Document action to route an Initialized or Saved document to
                    other users. Only the initiator of the document can take this action unless the
                    user has an "Initiate Document" KIM permission (or initiator_must_route policy
                    is set to false in the Document Type, although this feature is deprecated). The
                    Action Taken for a Route Document action is Complete.</para>
                <para>When you use the Route Document action, it Deactivates all pending requests
                    for the initiator of the document and it associates a Complete Action Taken with
                    the Deactivated requests. The document's state is then set to Enroute.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Save Document Action</title>
                <para>Use this action to put a newly created document in the Action List of the
                    document's initiator. You can only use this action on a document in an Initiated
                    status. When you use this action, KEW creates and Activates a Complete action
                    request for the document's initiator and then changes the document's status to
                    Saved.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Recall</title>
                <para>Use this action to recall a document that has been submitted to your action list. 
                    You can only use this action on a document if you have a specific role for the application
                    and/or document you are trying to recall. When you use this action, you are given the option 
                    to recall the document to your action list for updating or you can recall and cancel the document
                    with one action if it is no longer needed.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Superuser Actions </title>
                <para>Superuser actions let you move a document past workflow nodes where it may be
                    held up because another user is unavailable to take action on it or due to a
                    system problem. Superuser actions are an administrative tool and safety net.
                    Superusers are designated with a KIM Permission (or they are listed in the
                    Document Type, but this feature is deprecated). </para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Using the Superuser Functions</title>
                <para>To use the Superuser functions, go to Document Search (it is a link in the
                    left menu) and click the Superuser Search link.</para>
                <para>Now, do a normal document search for the document on which you need to perform
                    a Superuser action. When you find the document, click the Document/Notification
                    Id link. If you are authorized to perform a Superuser action on this document,
                    this takes you to the Superuser page. Otherwise, KEW displays a message that you
                    are not authorized to take Superuser action on this document.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Superuser Approve Document Action</title>
                <para>This action fully approves a document, Deactivating all remaining routing
                    requests. KEW also records a Superuser Approve Action Taken and associates it
                    with the Deactivated requests. The document's state changes to Approved and the
                    document is scheduled for processing. The document status automatically changes
                    to Final when it goes into the Workflow Engine. </para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Superuser Approve Node Action</title>
                <para>This action approves the document through all nodes up to (but not including)
                    a specified node. When the document gets to the specified node, requests are
                    created as usual. This action is exactly the same as Blanket Approve except that
                    no notification requests are created from the Superuser Approve Node
                    action.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Superuser Approve Request Action</title>
                <para>This action approves a single pending Approve or Complete action request. This
                    works the same way as a standard Approve action except that the Superuser is
                    acting in place of the responsible user.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Superuser Cancel Action</title>
                <para>This action cancels the document. This action works exactly the same way as
                    the standard Cancel action except that the Superuser does not need to have a
                    pending request to Cancel a document.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Superuser Disapprove Action</title>
                <para>This action disapproves the document. This action works the same way as the
                    standard Disapprove action except that the Superuser does not need to have a
                    pending request to perform the action. Also, on a Superuser disapprove, KEW does
                    not send notification requests.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Superuser Return to Previous Node Action</title>
                <para>This action returns the document to a previous node in the route path. This
                    action works exactly the same way as the standard Return to Previous Node action
                    except that the Superuser does not need to have a pending request to perform the
                    action.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Superuser Quick Action's Tab</title>
                <para>With the release of Rice 2.1 a new option is available for applications to enable. 
                    Superuser's can now access documents directly from the standard document search 
                    and quickly perform approval, acknowledgment, FYI, or disapproval actions from this 
                    new tab on the document. This streamlined version of the still available superuser 
                    form of document search will allow for common actions to be taken in a more user 
                    friendly fashion. Pending actions are displayed in a list that the super user can 
                    check off and take the actions necessary all at once (see example below). 
                    Before actions can be taken, a annotation must be provided.</para>
                <para>By default, the new tab will not appear on a document.  
                    <programlisting>&lt;kul:superUserActions /></programlisting>This needs to be included in the JSP of 
                    a document for the superuser tab to be shown. The logic for whether it should actually display anything 
                    is contained inside of this. Developers may also look at KualiMaintenanceDocument.jsp in the Rice code for an example.</para>
