    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>eDocLite is a simple, form-based framework designed for rapid development and
        implementation within an existing Kuali Enterprise Workflow (KEW) infrastructure. It allows
        for the development of simple web applications, their forms and simple routing
        configurations using XML. Users only have to enter data into the form and then submit it.
        Rules can be constructed so that the form is then routed to a specific user or KIM Group
        based on the data entered. It can be integrated with larger applications using a database
        layer post-processor component. </para>
    <para>Web pages called eDoc's are generated and are associated with a specific document
        type definition that provides the overall definition for how the document can be
        routed. Document types can also exist in hierarchies which provide storage of common
        information at various levels.</para>

    <para>The form uses an XSLT stylesheet to generate the html code. It uses XML to define form
        fields. Certain workflow classes make helper data available to the stylesheet programmer,
        and there are several features that can be 'plugged-in' to eDocLite to further enhance its
        usability in many situations. The actual form display is called an EDL. This diagram shows
        how these objects are related:</para>
