            actions on an eDocLite by adding annotations. The annotation appears in the

        <title>Extendable functions</title>
        <para>eDocLites are highly customizable. New eDocLites can be designed for new
            business and functional requirements. The document header and routing annotation
            and notes parts will be same or similar, the form will be different. </para>
        <para>eDocLites can be designed to include following functions:</para>
        <section>
            <title>Restricted read/write rights</title>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Some fields in eDocLite can be set as <emphasis role="keyword"
                        >GlobalReadOnly</emphasis>. With this setting they are disabled
                        and can't be edited by any user other than the author. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Some fields in eDocLite can be set as <emphasis role="keyword"
                        >ReadOnly</emphasis>, but users with rights can still edit them.
                        After the initiator writes them they are disabled and become locked
                        to some of the users in the routing process. But for users with
                        proper rights in certain nodes in the routing process, the fields
                        will become editable again. These users can take actions on them,
                        such as modify, add, and return to a former routing node.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Hidden fields</title>
            <para>To accommodate some business requirements, certain fields and notes can be
                hidden from certain nodes in the routing process. For instance, some
                administrative notes on a course waiver request will be hidden from students
                when s/he gets the eDocLite form in the final stage of the routing
                process.</para>
