    <section><title>Example 1 Form</title>
        <para>This simple first example form can be used to gather data from an initiator, then route the document when the submit button is pressed to one of two nodes depending on the value the initiator selects from a field called campus. It makes use of several common html field types. Any number of notes can be added as well as any number of attachments. In this example, the campus field has two possible selection choices (only first on shown in the picture).
