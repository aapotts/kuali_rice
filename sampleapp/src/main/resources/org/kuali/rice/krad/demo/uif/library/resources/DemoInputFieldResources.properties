@cmp{Demo-InputField-View}#description=\
  <p>Field that processes/displays data with a control, linked directly to a property on the \
  form for this view.</p> \
<p> \
  The InputField provides the majority of the data input/output \
for the screen. Through these fields the model can be displayed and updated. \
For data input, the field contains a Control instance which will  \
render HTML input controls. The input field also contains a \
label, instructionalText, constraintText, and widgets such as a quickfinder (for \
looking up values) and inquiry (for getting more information on the value).\
InputField instances can have associated messages (errors)\
due to invalid input or business rule failures. Security can also be  \
configured to restrict who may view the fields value. \
</p>
@cmp{Demo-InputField-View}#usage=\
  <p>The InputField is all about data entry for the user.  The main function of an InputField \
  is to tie a Control to a property (referenced by its propertyName) on the form.  This data can then be used by the\
  controller to persist or perform other operations.</p>\
  <p>InputFields can be used in 2 ways: \
<ol>          \
<li>Input data</li>    \
<li>View data</li>   \
</ol>   \
