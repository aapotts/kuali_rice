<p>The original concept and code base for P6Spy was conceived and developed by Andy Martin, Ph.D. who generously contributed the first complete release to the public under this license.&nbsp; This product was due to the pioneering work of Andy that began in December of 1995 developing applications that could seamlessly be deployed with minimal effort but with dramatic results.&nbsp; This code is maintained and extended by Jeff Goke and with the ideas and contributions of other P6Spy contributors.
