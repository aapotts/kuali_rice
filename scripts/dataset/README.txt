This directory is no longer being used.

The sql files that were here before are now in ../../db/sql/src/main/resources

The properties files are replaced by pom configuration in db/impex/master/pom.xml,
db/impex/demo/pom.xml, and db/impex/bootstrap/pom.xml.

The Rice build produces jar files containing the Impex for each:

rice-impex-master.jar
rice-impex-demo.jar
rice-impex-bootstrap.jar
